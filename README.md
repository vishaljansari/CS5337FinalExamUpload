Meeting venue-Et 245, Time-4pm, Date:12th october,2016

# we studied MORE about git , watched the video provided in csns to be more confident using GIT.
# Issues discussed - A star algo implementation, Communication module , collecting radio-active elements
resolving merge conflict and local errors occuring in eclipse.
# Solved the error about rover as we have modified the movement algo,earlier it used to go vertically or horizontally 
but right now we implemented new method so it started moving in all direction.
#The rover moves in zig-zag direction and aims in the destination co-ordinates(jackpot)

                                            2) Sagar & juhi - working on drill part
